# Getting Started Tutorial
This is a quick and simple getting started tutorial, showing you how to get Pie set up, and the very basics of graphics
programming.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:
* Install Pie
* Create a Window and Graphics Device
* Clear and present to the screen
* Create buffers & other objects using the Graphics Device
* Write basic HLSL shaders
* Draw a colourful rectangle to the screen

This may look like a lot of steps, but don't worry. This tutorial will explain everything in detail, and once you get
the basics, the rest should become a lot easier.

### Already familiar with graphics programming?
Great! This tutorial is mostly useless for you, although it may act as a good way to learn Pie's API. However, you may
wish to look at the [Pie examples, tutorials, and demos](https://github.com/piegfx/Pie/tree/main/examples) instead, as
this gives a more comprehensive look into the overall API.
