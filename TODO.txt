TODO: A list of todos. Prefixed with TODO because rider has a very handy list. Written in order of importance.

Important:
- Make more items use D3D11-like description for objects, such as texture description (but not buffers, they will remain the same)
- More Draw() functions, including support for vertex buffers without indices
- Multiple VBOs/Instanced rendering support
- Render target support (very important for shadows)
- Stencil states
- Deferred contexts (yes, even for OpenGL)
- OpenGL custom back-buffer (using framebuffer) to allow specifying formats etc on startup.

Into the future:
- Vulkan support (however may be for pie 2.0 as will most likely require major changes to run optimally)
